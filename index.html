        <p>Some inventions of Nikola Tesla</p>
        <ul>

            <p>
              <b>The Tesla Coil</b> - Chances are that you have already seen
              this invention. It is a transformer used to produce high-voltage,
              low-current, high-frequency alternating-current electricity. To
              observers, it appears as if lightning is being shot into the air.

              <b>The Magnifying Transmitter</b> - Tesla had intended the Tesla
              Coil to be part of a wireless power system and was a mainstay of
              many of Tesla’s other experiments. By running a wire connected to
              the resonator around his lab he permeated his lab with
              electromagnetic energy and was able to light a fluorescent bulb
              held in his hand because the voltage drop through the air was
              great enough to cause a sufficient current flow.

              <b>The Tesla Turbine</b> - Tesla saw the rise of the piston engine
              in the automobile industry as a way to make a change in the world.
              He developed his own turbine-style engine that used combustion to
              make disks rotate. The fuel efficiency of his engine was as high
              as 90%, a big achievement considering this is similar to the
              efficiency of some modern turbines.

              <b>The Shadowgraph</b> - While Rontgen has been credited with
              developing the first X-ray films, called shadowgraphs, there is
              clear evidence that Tesla was also working in this area. The
              problem is that Tesla lost a lot of his work due to a fire in his
              lab. Tesla may well have produced the first x-ray image in the
              United States when he attempted to use a vacuum tube to obtain an
              image of Mark Twain. However, instead of Twain, the resulting
              image showed the screw for adjusting the camera lens.

              <b>The Radio</b> - Before his lab burned down, Tesla discovered
              that he could use his coils to transmit and receive powerful radio
              signals, tuning them to resonate at the same frequency. By early
              1895, he was ready to transmit a signal 50 miles from his lab, to
              West Point, New York. But the fire in Tesla's lab destroyed his
              work. While he was rebuilding, a young Italian experimenter named
              Guglielmo Marconi, who was working in England, took out the first
              wireless telegraphy patent. When Marconi later set up
              long-distance demonstrations, he used a Tesla oscillator to
              transmit the signals across the English Channel.

              <b>The Neon Lamp</b> - Tesla did not invent fluorescent or neon
              lights, but he did contribute to improving both inventions. He
              took the lights and created the first neon sign. At the 1893
              Chicago World’s Fair, he demonstrated neon light signs and how
              they can make unique designs and even form words. Thanks to Tesla
              you can identify your favorite bar.

              <b>The Niagara Falls Transformer House</b> - When it came to
              deciding what company would build a power generator at Niagara
              Falls, Thomas Edison was the first choice. After reviewing Tesla’s
              work for Westinghouse Electric, though, the Niagara Falls
              commission went with Tesla’s alternating current power. Despite
              doubts, Tesla’s system worked well and became a standard for
              hydroelectric power.

              <b>The Induction Motor</b> - The first AC commutator-free
              three-phase induction motor was invented independently by Galileo
              Ferraris and Nikola Tesla. Although Ferraris presented his engine
              first, in 1885, it was Tesla who filed for a patent first. George
              Westinghouse, who was developing an alternating current power
              system at that time, licensed Tesla's patents in 1888. This type
              of motor is commonly used in vacuums, blow dryers, and power
              tools, even today.

              <b>The Radio Controlled Boat</b> - The Teleautomaton was the first
              radio-controlled boat that was designed by Tesla. After being
              denied a patent because the patent office didn’t think it was
              feasible, he proved them wrong by demonstrating the boat at the
              Electrical Exhibition in 1898.

              <b>Alternating Current</b> - Alternating current is considered
              Tesla’s crowning achievement. While not the inventor of AC power,
              he made it easy to use widespread. AC power allows for electricity
              to be sent over long distances much more efficiently. Westinghouse
              bought Tesla’s AC patents and used them to bid on the lighting of
              the Chicago World’s Fair.
