        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>The Tesla Coil</strong> - Chances are that you have
              already seen this invention. It is a transformer used to produce
              high-voltage, low-current, high-frequency alternating-current
              electricity. To observers, it appears as if lightning is being
              shot into the air.

              <strong>The Magnifying Transmitter</strong> - Tesla had intended
              the Tesla Coil to be part of a wireless power system and was a
              mainstay of many of Tesla’s other experiments. By running a wire
              connected to the resonator around his lab he permeated his lab
              with electromagnetic energy and was able to light a fluorescent
              bulb held in his hand because the voltage drop through the air was
              great enough to cause a sufficient current flow.

              <strong>The Tesla Turbine</strong> - Tesla saw the rise of the
              piston engine in the automobile industry as a way to make a change
              in the world. He developed his own turbine-style engine that used
              combustion to make disks rotate. The fuel efficiency of his engine
              was as high as 90%, a big achievement considering this is similar
              to the efficiency of some modern turbines.

              <strong>The Shadowgraph</strong> - While Rontgen has been credited
              with developing the first X-ray films, called shadowgraphs, there
              is clear evidence that Tesla was also working in this area. The
              problem is that Tesla lost a lot of his work due to a fire in his
              lab. Tesla may well have produced the first x-ray image in the
              United States when he attempted to use a vacuum tube to obtain an
              image of Mark Twain. However, instead of Twain, the resulting
              image showed the screw for adjusting the camera lens.

              <strong>The Radio</strong> - Before his lab burned down, Tesla
              discovered that he could use his coils to transmit and receive
              powerful radio signals, tuning them to resonate at the same
              frequency. By early 1895, he was ready to transmit a signal 50
              miles from his lab, to West Point, New York. But the fire in
              Tesla's lab destroyed his work. While he was rebuilding, a young
              Italian experimenter named Guglielmo Marconi, who was working in
              England, took out the first wireless telegraphy patent. When
              Marconi later set up long-distance demonstrations, he used a Tesla
              oscillator to transmit the signals across the English Channel.

              <strong>The Neon Lamp</strong> - Tesla did not invent fluorescent
              or neon lights, but he did contribute to improving both
              inventions. He took the lights and created the first neon sign. At
              the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair, he demonstrated neon light signs
              and how they can make unique designs and even form words. Thanks
              to Tesla you can identify your favorite bar.

              <strong>The Niagara Falls Transformer House</strong> - When it
              came to deciding what company would build a power generator at
              Niagara Falls, Thomas Edison was the first choice. After reviewing
              Tesla’s work for Westinghouse Electric, though, the Niagara Falls
              commission went with Tesla’s alternating current power. Despite
              doubts, Tesla’s system worked well and became a standard for
              hydroelectric power.

              <strong>The Induction Motor</strong> - The first AC
              commutator-free three-phase induction motor was invented
              independently by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla. Although
              Ferraris presented his engine first, in 1885, it was Tesla who
              filed for a patent first. George Westinghouse, who was developing
              an alternating current power system at that time, licensed Tesla's
              patents in 1888. This type of motor is commonly used in vacuums,
              blow dryers, and power tools, even today.

              <strong>The Radio Controlled Boat</strong> - The Teleautomaton was
              the first radio-controlled boat that was designed by Tesla. After
              being denied a patent because the patent office didn’t think it
              was feasible, he proved them wrong by demonstrating the boat at
              the Electrical Exhibition in 1898.

              <strong>Alternating Current</strong> - Alternating current is
              considered Tesla’s crowning achievement. While not the inventor of
              AC power, he made it easy to use widespread. AC power allows for
              electricity to be sent over long distances much more efficiently.
              Westinghouse bought Tesla’s AC patents and used them to bid on the
              lighting of the Chicago World’s Fair.
